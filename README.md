#### CFPB Open Source Project Template Instructions

1. Create a new project.
2. Copy these files into the new project.
3. Update the README, replacing the contents below as prescribed.
4. Add any libraries, assets, or hard dependencies whose source code will be included
   in the project's repository to the _Exceptions_ section in the [TERMS](TERMS.md).
  - If no exceptions are needed, remove that section from TERMS.
5. If working with an existing code base, answer the questions on the [open source checklist](opensource-checklist.md)
6. Delete these instructions and everything up to the _Project Title_ from the README.
7. Write some great software and tell people about it.

> Keep the README fresh! It's the first thing people see and will make the initial impression.
